# Cult of 1.0
### You Are Here! We Are Here! I Am Here! 

Welcome! It's an honor to have you as a like-minded friend. You and I believe exactly the same thing so far. I have taken the liberty of creating and documenting my own path. I invite you to follow along and feel free to create a branch when we cease to agree on a topic. In order to be in Group 1.0 though, there are some ground rules. You may believe anything in this thread 100%, but if you violate any of the rules in this PRIMARY group, you will be asked to account for your violation and be subject to our ruling.  (Note to self: Create a judicial system). 

If you want to skip ahead, we can get to the point you want to get to. Interested in Government Financial Systems and Responsibilities? Go there. Want to work on what Our stance on Climate Change is? Join that group. The early parts of this discovery process involves a lot of zeros and ones, so after the brief list of Rules, we'll put some quick links to some deeeeeep core beliefs enmass.   

* Rule #1 is the Golden Rule.   
* Rule #1.1 is that we don't know everything.   

I believe Rule #1.11111111111111111111111111111.... (or +1∞)  Call me "1". It's very nice to meet you. I'm not a snob. If you like, I can call you "1+". Deal? That just means you and I agree and are like-minded. Where we disagree, you would refer to our relationship as -1 on a topic. So, I would be "1.1-" where "1" is me and "1-" is our relationship. The dot is the decimal place. Yay, New Speak. Just what a cult needs. 

To create a new repo of your own, name the repo the binary value of a binary question. For example, If you choose answer 0 for group 101010101010101010101 you will then belong to group 1010101010101010101010. That may be a highly detailed believe, and you may be alone. That's a good time to check yourself and check the path you may have not neccessarily chosen on purpose. You may have accidentally picked Group X when you should have picked Group Y, and as a result isolated yourself at your current grouping due to a conflict you may have created by accident or it's possible that you don't believe what you believe at some level. Have fun. Seek help from above (1.0) if you get anyone violating any rules. And there will be no more wishing for more Genies. I'm not falling for that again. 


### Rules of Group 1: 
The general ruleset of Group 1.x.y.z or whatever is that we exist, we are conscious, we are experiencing a physical expanse measured in the distance the fastest thing we know covers in a planetary year. The light year. We are conscience and something is happening. Things are moving, colliding, expanding, converting, speeding up, slowing down, igniting, burning out. Something is clearly happening, but what is it and why is it happening? 

## Group 0.9:
There is something happening (1.0), but it isn't happening for any reason. This is all random. Please consider joining [1.0CB](https://github.com/GiovanniDeCarlina/1.0CB/edit/main/README.md)

#### Group 1.0:
Light is the fastest thing in the Universe. Actually, the true Group 1.0 would be, "There's another Universe called Universe+1.1, but they call themselves Universe+1.0". But I'm only talking about this Universe.

#### Group 1.1: 
There are things about the Universe that we do not know. One of those things may be something that travels faster than light. We have no evidence in favor or against that we know everything there is to know. I suspect we do not know everything there is. The collection of groups, u/Universes, Rules, etc with corresponding values believe corresponding things. You are in a group who believes rules and lives here. This is true for #1 and #1.1 inclusively. 1.1 may or may not have a 1.1.0 and 1.1.1. 

##### Spoilers!
It does. 

* 1.1.0:

* 1.1.1: 

---

### Make your decision: 
Now, please answer the following series of binary (true/false, yes/no, 0/1, etc.) questions.   
Please only answer the question at hand and give no consideration to any previous questions or possible next questions.   
This is a test, designed to produce an emotional response....  
  
### Previous questions:
* ? = Any previous question
* -∞ M0 = Null without Math
* -∞ Null with Math
* 0 = Nothing exists
* 1.0 = Something exists (More Math and all sorts of stuff becomes true)
  * <B><--- You Are Here. Happy Journey! Hope you meet some good people and are able to handle the bad ones.</B> See: [Note 1](#note-1)
* 10 = Rule 2
* 100 = Rule 4
* 1000 = Rule 8
* 10000 = Rule 16
* 100000 = Rule 32
* Etc... to Rule +∞
* Followed by Rule +2∞
* Rule +100∞
* Rule +1000∞
* Rule +10000∞
* As far as one would need.

> [!NOTE]
> Really, I hope there isn't going to be any fighting between differences. Hmmm, I need a rule book. OK, Rule #1.0A

## 1.0A:
Thou shalt be nice to each other. As much as you can ya' know. 

## 1.0B:
Thou shalt try to be nice and not be mean. Fair? 

## 1.0C:
Thou shalt understand what life is and what it isn't. 

### What We believe (1.0C):
We believe that life is that which posesses abilities that non-life objects (rocks, light, Kool-Aid) do not and cannot possess. As a rule, non-living objects cannot move on their own. They are unable to make decisions about any facet of their existance - as far as we know. The Universe could be a wacky place. Leave some small amount of room for "people" who don't look like us. To be "alive" we believe something much (at a minimum) reproduction, but things that can think are also "alive". Sofar as we know, things that are not "alive" cannot think. We're pretty sure they are unable to move on their own, but some people believe there's a place in the desert where rocks move and leave a trail. If you're one of them, your probably looking for a direct link from  1.0 to the [link](We'll believe anything) group. You will find likeminded people there. Be aware of the rules above, eh? K THX BYE.  

### 1.0CA: 
Thou believeth that life is unique as far as we know, but there may be life elsewhere we are not aware of. 

#### 1.0CAA:
If we are unique, we are somehow special in a vast horizon of possibilities.

or

### 1.0CB
Thar be nothin' out there. Unfund NASA. Fund NASSCAR. 

or 

### 1.0CC:
AKA "The 1 CC group" as in drugs.  I am from another space-time beyond your own. Take me to your leader. Is this the planet Houston?

# 1

You answered 1. You exist! Yay You! (maybe).  Welcome to the: 

### Cult of 1.0
#### You Are Here! We Are Here! I Am Here! 

### Rules of Group 1: 
The general ruleset of Group 1.x.y.z or whatever is that we exist, we are conscious, we are experiencing a physical expanse measured in the distance the fastest thing we know covers in a planetary year. The light year. 

#### Group 1.0:
Light is the fastest thing in the Universe. Actually, the true Group 1.0 would be, "There's another Universe called Universe+1.1, but they call themselves Universe+1.0". But I'm only talking about this Universe.

#### Group 1.1: 
There are things about the Universe that we do not know. One of those things may be something that travels faster than light. We have no evidence in favor or against that we know everything there is to know. I suspect we do not know everything there is. The collection of groups, u/Universes, Rules, etc with corresponding values believe corresponding things. You are in a group who believes rules and lives here. This is true for #1 and #1.1 inclusively. 1.1 may or may not have a 1.1.0 and 1.1.1. 

##### Spoilers!
It does. 

* 1.1.0:

* 1.1.1:

> [!NOTE]
> Really, I hope there isn't going to be any fighting between differences. Hmmm, I need a rule book. OK, Rule #1.0A

## 1.0A:
Thou shalt be nice to each other. As much as you can ya' know. 

## 1.0B:
Thou shalt try to be nice and not be mean. Fair? 

## 1.0C:
Thou shalt understand what life is and what it isn't. 

### What We believe (1.0C):
We believe that life is that which posesses abilities that non-life objects (rocks, light, Kool-Aid) do not and cannot possess. As a rule, non-living objects cannot move on their own. They are unable to make decisions about any facet of their existance - as far as we know. The Universe could be a wacky place. Leave some small amount of room for "people" who don't look like us. To be "alive" we believe something much (at a minimum) reproduction, but things that can think are also "alive". Sofar as we know, things that are not "alive" cannot think. We're pretty sure they are unable to move on their own, but some people believe there's a place in the desert where rocks move and leave a trail. If you're one of them, your probably looking for a direct link from  1.0 to the [link](We'll believe anything) group. You will find likeminded people there. Be aware of the rules above, eh? K THX BYE.  

### 1.0CA: 
Thou believeth that life is unique as far as we know, but there may be life elsewhere we are not aware of. 

#### 1.0CAA:
If we are unique, we are somehow special in a vast horizon of possibilities.

or

### 1.0CB
Thar be nothin' out there. Unfund NASA. Fund NASSCAR. 

or 

### 1.0CC:
AKA "The 1 CC group" as in drugs.  I am from another space-time beyond your own. Take me to your leader. Is this the planet Houston?
